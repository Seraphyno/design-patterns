### Observer

###### Problem
We want to create a news notification system (news agency), which notifies observers (channels) about the changes in its state

###### Solution
- Create a basic implementation of news agency and channel and make one observe the other
- Use the Observable interface from java library to demonstrate secondary approach
- Test, test, test
