### Decorator

###### Problem
We want to create a tree for Christmas, but depending on the owner it should be decorated differently

###### Solution
- Create a basic implementation of tree
- Create an abstract tree decorator which holds the Christmas tree implementation
- Create 2 separate implementations of tree decorators, extending the base one 
- Test, test, test
